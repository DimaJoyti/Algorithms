## 🔄 Types of Scaling

### Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
**Definition**: Adding more power (CPU, RAM, storage) to existing machines

**Advantages**:
- Simple to implement - no code changes needed
- No data consistency issues
- Lower complexity

**Disadvantages**:
- Hardware limits (finite ceiling)
- Single point of failure
- Expensive at scale
- Downtime during upgrades

**When to Use**:
- Early stage applications
- Monolithic architectures
- Database systems requiring ACID properties
- Applications with tight coupling

### Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
**Definition**: Adding more machines to handle increased load

**Advantages**:
- Theoretically unlimited scaling
- Better fault tolerance
- Cost-effective with commodity hardware
- No single point of failure

**Disadvantages**:
- Increased complexity
- Data consistency challenges
- Network latency between nodes
- More complex deployment and monitoring

**When to Use**:
- High-traffic web applications
- Microservices architectures
- Stateless services
- Big data processing

## 🎯 Load Distribution Strategies

### 1. Load Balancing Algorithms

#### Round Robin
```go
type RoundRobinBalancer struct {
    servers []string
    current int
    mutex   sync.Mutex
}

func (rb *RoundRobinBalancer) NextServer() string {
    rb.mutex.Lock()
    defer rb.mutex.Unlock()
    
    server := rb.servers[rb.current]
    rb.current = (rb.current + 1) % len(rb.servers)
    return server
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(1)
**Space Complexity**: O(1)
**Use Case**: When all servers have similar capacity

#### Weighted Round Robin
```go
type WeightedServer struct {
    Address string
    Weight  int
    Current int
}

func (wb *WeightedBalancer) NextServer() string {
    // Implementation similar to your algorithms collection
    // Uses weighted selection algorithm
}
```

#### Least Connections
**Algorithm**: Route to server with fewest active connections
**Time Complexity**: O(n) to find minimum
**Optimization**: Use min-heap for O(log n)

#### Consistent Hashing
**Use Case**: Distributed caching, database sharding
**Advantage**: Minimal redistribution when nodes added/removed

```go
// Similar to hash table implementation in your datastructures package
type ConsistentHash struct {
    ring     map[uint32]string
    sortedKeys []uint32
    replicas int
}
```

### 2. Geographic Distribution

#### Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
- **Edge Locations**: Serve content from nearest geographic location
- **Cache Strategy**: Similar to your caching algorithms
- **Latency Reduction**: Speed of light limitations

#### Multi-Region Deployment
- **Active-Active**: Traffic distributed across regions
- **Active-Passive**: Failover to backup region
- **Data Locality**: Keep data close to users

## 📊 Capacity Planning Principles

### 1. Performance Metrics

#### Throughput
- **Requests Per Second (RPS)**
- **Queries Per Second (QPS)**
- **Transactions Per Second (TPS)**

#### Latency
- **Response Time**: Time to process single request
- **P50, P95, P99**: Percentile-based measurements
- **Tail Latency**: Worst-case performance

#### Availability
- **Uptime Percentage**: 99.9% = 8.76 hours downtime/year
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**
- **Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)**

### 2. Capacity Estimation Framework

#### Step 1: Define Requirements
```
Example: Design a URL shortener
- 100M URLs shortened per day
- 10:1 read/write ratio
- 5-year data retention
```

#### Step 2: Calculate QPS
```
Write QPS = 100M / (24 * 3600) = ~1,160 QPS
Read QPS = 1,160 * 10 = ~11,600 QPS
Peak QPS = 2 * Average QPS (safety margin)
```

#### Step 3: Storage Estimation
```
URL entries per day = 100M
Storage per entry = 500 bytes (URL + metadata)
Daily storage = 100M * 500 bytes = 50GB
5-year storage = 50GB * 365 * 5 = ~91TB
```

#### Step 4: Bandwidth Calculation
```
Write bandwidth = 1,160 QPS * 500 bytes = 580 KB/s
Read bandwidth = 11,600 QPS * 500 bytes = 5.8 MB/s
```

#### Step 5: Memory Requirements
```
Cache 20% of daily reads
Cache size = 11,600 * 3600 * 24 * 0.2 * 500 bytes = ~100GB
```

### 3. Growth Planning

#### Linear Growth
- Predictable scaling needs
- Easy to plan capacity
- Example: B2B applications

#### Exponential Growth
- Viral applications
- Requires over-provisioning
- Example: Social media platforms

#### Seasonal Patterns
- E-commerce during holidays
- Video streaming during events
- Plan for peak loads

## 🔧 Practical Applications

### Database Scaling Strategies

#### Read Replicas
```
Master (Write) → Replica 1 (Read)
              → Replica 2 (Read)
              → Replica 3 (Read)
```

#### Sharding
```go
// Horizontal partitioning
func GetShardKey(userID int) int {
    return userID % numShards
}

// Range-based sharding
func GetShardByRange(userID int) int {
    if userID < 1000000 {
        return 0
    } else if userID < 2000000 {
        return 1
    }
    // ... more ranges
}
```

#### Federation
- Split databases by feature
- Users DB, Products DB, Orders DB
- Reduces load per database

### Caching Layers

#### Application Level
```go
// In-memory cache (similar to your cache package)
type LRUCache struct {
    capacity int
    cache    map[string]*Node
    head     *Node
    tail     *Node
}
```

#### Database Level
- Query result caching
- Connection pooling
- Buffer pool optimization

#### CDN Level
- Static content caching
- Dynamic content caching
- Edge computing

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with vertical scaling, move to horizontal when needed
2. **Measure First**: Use data to drive scaling decisions
3. **Plan for Failure**: Design for fault tolerance from the beginning
4. **Cache Strategically**: Apply caching at multiple levels
5. **Monitor Everything**: Observability is crucial for scaling decisions
